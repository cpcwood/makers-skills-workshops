# Project idea generation workshop

### PART 1

* The workshop facilitator, aka a coach, will give a brief intro of the point of this workshop.

* For 5 mins, individually, write out ideas and post them on the wall. Feel free to read others as they are posted.

* Next, the coach will read them all out so you have read/heard all of the ideas.

* You have a 15 min break, where the coach will organise the ideas into categories by the type of idea it is and the kinds of working styles it may involve.

* After the break you'll see the resulting categories and you'll prioritise the categories in an attempt to eliminate the least favourite ones by spending 2 votes per person on categories you like.

* A form will be sent around for you to list your top two categories, with a deadline

### PART 2

* Teams are announced

* A coach will organise and facilitate 20 mins break out sessions for each team to narrow in on an idea.
